## PLAN9-UTIL-PORT
------------------
This is a re implementation of the Plan9 Commands over to Linux.
Pretty straight forward and simple to use.

------------------------
```bash
make
```

To test out / run the commands go into the bin/ directory.

To install / replace the linux standarized commands with the port:
```bash
make install
```
